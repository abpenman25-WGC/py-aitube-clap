._Sid v.O.
>:For so many years we gazed into the
>:darkness, thinking we wouldn't make
>:it. An Earth with no future. And
>:just when our beautiful world
>:needed us the most, we saw the rise
>:of dictators, who denied the need
>:for action. By the time they faded,
>:we were left with a world in
.:crisis. Then it happened.
..Lights start to become visible on Earth.
._SID V.O. (CONT'D)
>:As atmospheres became unbearable in
>:parts of China and India, nations
>:came together raising billions of
>:dollars. Renewable energies and the
>:emergence of Z-Pulse Power proved
>:to be game changers, and then,
.:things started to improve.
..Lights on Earth become bright.
._SID V.O. (CONT'D)
>:Grateful nations emerged, willing
>:to work together like never before.
>:So, we kept going. It was the

.:the edge.
>.Pan around to shuttle in distance, heading for Moon, begin

._SID V.O. (CONT'D)
>:3D manufacturing was the next

>:solar system. Corporations took
>:over space exploration, looking for
.:resources.
..Move behind shuttle, with Moon in foreground. 
._SID V.O. (CONT'D)
>:And organic technology gave us an
>:exciting new hope. Computers that
>:could mimic the human brain, might
>:one day answer the question, how
>:does one travel faster than

>:that we had passed from the

..for his age.
._Professor
.:Hello Diane.
..Diane adjusts her sitting position.
._DIANE
>:So we all know about organic
>:computers, "Organics," as we call
.:them.
..The Professor nods.
._DIANE (CONT'D)
>:These are computers which mimic the
>:human brain, producing depth of
>:thought, hopefully to one day
>:answer the question, how does one
.:travel faster than light?
..The Professor smiles.
._ProFESSOR
>:Yes. That's the objective.
>:Traditional computers have become
.:incredibly fast, but have limits.
..Diane leans forward, motions with her hands.
._DIANE
>:And those are the computers we all
.:use?
..Professor nods.
._PROFESSOR
>:Yes, indeed, however, for the
>:question of FTL, we require 
>:conceptualization, along with an
>:understanding of the laws of
>:physics and the ability to think
.:around the problem.
>.Diane becomes very focused, motions with her hands as she
..says, "woke up."
._DIANE
>:And so you built these computers to
>:be more and more sophisticated, and
.:then one day one of them, woke up.
>.Eerie music. Professor squirms in chair a little, looks
..somewhat uncomfortable.
._PROFESSOR
>:Yes, and we discovered what is now
>:called the, "Organic Threshold,"
>:the point at which depth of thought
.:becomes an entity.
..Diane leans in.
._DIANE
.:And you all thought eureka.
..Professor becomes a little defensive.
._PROFESSOR
>:Look, it was a remarkable event, we
.:all remember that day.
._DIANE
.:Then the entity became unstable.
..Professor hesitates, looks thoughtful.
._PROFESSOR
>:When one becomes aware, one
>:contemplates existence, one does
.:not solve equations.
..Diane points to herself.
._DIANE
>:Who am I, what am I, who are my
.:creators, am I a slave?
..Eerie music. Professor looks uncomfortable.

>:A human child has years to develop

..Professor searches for right word.
._PROFESSOR (CONT'D)
>:A being. These systems try to
>:absorb everything at once and it is
.:challenging.

>:It has no body! This is from an old
>:1950's horror film with a living
.:head in a glass jar.
>.Clip of horror film comes on screen, head with eyes open, in
..glass jar, looking around.
._DIANE (CONT'D)
>:That's the image that comes to
>:mind! It's a brain, in a box, on a
.:shelf.
..Professor laughs uncomfortably.
._PROFESSOR
>:That's not the image that comes to
.:my mind.
..Diane motions with hands.
._DIANE
>:OK, so you connected the Organic to
>:a virtual world and it chose a
.:female form.
..Clips of blonde female, facing away from camera.
._DIANE (CONT'D)
>:And it retreats into that world,
.:and stops communicating.
..Professor nods.
._PROFESSOR
.:Yes. It refused to talk to us.
._DIANE
>:And then you turned off that world,
.:and.
>.Clip of blonde woman charging camera, screaming (no sound),
>.trying to get at those behind camera, movements look like
..something out of horror film. Then clip of woman lying dead.
._DIANE (CONT'D)
.:It went mad and then died.
..Professor quiet, sullen, nods.
._PROFESSOR
>:The challenges of stabilizing such
>:an entity appear to be as complex
.:as the challenges of FTL.
..Diane motions to the Professor.
._DIANE
.:Is there a solution?
..Professor strained smile.
._PROFESSOR
>:Research continues, but we are
.:currently ... over our heads,
>.Diane gasps slightly, then laughs, as the Professor
..dissappears. She motions to the audience.
._DIANE
>:Pun intended? Thank you Professor,

..He gesture to the Commander again.
._COMMANDER STONE
>:Problem is, we thought this was the

._DIRECTOR LEE
>:No one knew, none of the

._COMMANDER STONE
>:We used our best stealth & cloaking

._SID
.:Professor, what did you find?
..Professor acts nonchalant.
._PROFESSOR
>:It appears to be some kind of

..Sid and Alex respond in unison.
._Sid & Alex
.((shock and surprise)
.:Activate it!
..Director Lee looks at the Professor, accusingly.
._DIRECTOR LEE
>:Now, you say that you did not

>:Look, it's completely isolated and

..Professor looks more defensive.
._PROFESSOR (CONT'D)
>:Look, I've never seen it myself.
>:I've never been to Mars. I know

..The Professor puts his hands up, gestures.

>:They've asked me to take a look, so

>:OK, so here's the plan. As far as

._DIRECTOR LEE (CONT'D)

>:Commander Stone has full authority,

..The Commander leans forward.
._COMMANDER STONE
>:We are there to deal with any

>.The Director and Commander both look at Alex, shake heads,
..no, smile.
._COMMANDER STONE
.:No, not that hangar.
..Director Lee smiles at Alex, motions to the group.
._DIRECTOR LEE
>:18 months ago we opened one of the
>:largest 3D manufacturing facilities
>:ever built, right here on the Moon.
>:Technically, it's Corporate owned,
>:so the need for disclosure was
.:limited. 
..Same sly smile.
._DIRECTOR LEE (CONT'D)
>:Corporations are allowed to keep

..Commander gets up, walks around desk, sits on desk.
._COMMANDER STONE
>:The people who pay us have been

>.are recessed within thick armor. The commander motions at
..the armor.
._COMMANDER STONE
>:What we're looking at here is a new
>:type of ablative armor. As it burns
>:off it carbonizes and becomes more
>:and more resistant. It becomes
.:almost impervious to heat energy.
..Alex points at the armor.
._ALEX
>:That looks just like the armor on
.:the new tactical pods.
..The commander turns towards her and smiles.
._COMMANDER STONE
>:It is, except here the initial belt
>:is three feet thick and there are
>:two more thinner belts. It's just
>:as effective against heat, light,
>:radiation, kinetic or explosive
>:energy and it's much lighter than
.:it looks.
..Sid steps forward, points up at the ship.
._SID
>:So this has the latest Z-Pulse
.:Drive?
>.Director Lee looks at Sid, smiles, he looks at the Commander
..who nods.
._DIRECTOR LEE
>:In 2019 Z-Pulse power levels had
>:reached 350 terawatts, that's 350
.:trillion watts of power. 
..Director Lee points toward the ship.
._DIRECTOR LEE (CONT'D)
>:The General has two Z-Pulse, triple
>:core engines, each attaining a
>:maximum of 1800 terawatts and each
>:engine fires 12 times per minute,
>:so each core fires every 15
>:seconds. They fire directly into
>:containment rings, the energy never
>:leaves containment, and then we use
.:it at will.
..Sid looks at the director.
._SID
>:And if it uses lithium fuel, no

>:And we can channel that power
>:through our lasers, which can

>:What you're looking at is an

..He points down at the cores.
._COMMANDER STONE (CONT'D)
>:It takes about 24hrs. to fully

..He then looks at the group, shaking his head.
._COMMANDER STONE (CONT'D)
>:The ship is designed to have a

>:million kilometers per day, but we
>:haven't really tested it yet, so in
